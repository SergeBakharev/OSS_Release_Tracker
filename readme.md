# OSS Release Tracker

All of the code in `generated/` was written by [smol-developer-fork](https://github.com/sergebakharev/smol-developer).

After running the initial generation, I kept running the code, iteratively passing the latest error messages to the smol debugger, and followed it's suggestions of fixes until it worked. It's not pretty but this is the result.
